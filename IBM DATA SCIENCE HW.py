# Data Science Final Project
## Introduction
This notebook is created as part of the final project for the Data Science course. It includes various exercises demonstrating the use of markdown and code cells in a Jupyter notebook.
## Data Science Languages
Some of the popular languages that data scientists use are:
- Python
- R
- SQL
- Java
- Julia
- Keras
- C++
- etc...
## Data Science Libraries
Some of the commonly used libraries by data scientists include:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Plotly
- etc...
## Data Science Tools
| Tool           | Description                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Jupyter        | Interactive computing environment                   |
| RStudio        | IDE for R programming                               |
| Apache Hadoop  | Framework for distributed storage and processing    |
| TensorFlow     | Library for machine learning                        |
| Apache Spark   | Unified analytics engine for big data processin

## Arithmetic Expression Examples
In this section, we will demonstrate basic arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication.

# Code cell
# Example of multiplication and addition
a = 5
b = 4
multiplication_result = a * b
addition_result = a + b
multiplication_result, addition_result

# Code cell
# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 120
hours = minutes / 60
hours

## Objectives
The main objectives of this notebook are:
- To list popular languages for Data Science
- To list commonly used libraries in Data Science
- To present a table of Data Science tools
- To demonstrate basic arithmetic operations
- To convert time units
